# Module 1 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Mitigate Attacks with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.

To explore the Defender for Endpoint attack mitigation capabilities, you run six simulated attacks.

### Task 1: Simulated Attacks

In this task, you will run two simulated attacks to explore the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal in your browser, go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at (https://security.microsoft.com) logged in as Admin for your tenant.

2. From the menu, select **Evaluation & tutorials**  and then select **Tutorials & simulations** from the left side.

3. Complete the simulation titled *Automated investigation (backdoor)* and the tutorial titled *Automated investigation (fileless attack)*.  Follow the instructions in the provided documentation in the portal.

**Warning** The simulations and tutorials here are an excellent source of learning through practice.  Simulations and tutorials are being added and edited regularly in the portal.  However, some of these simulations & tutorials may interfere with performance of the labs designed for this training course.  Only perform the simulations and tutorials recommended in the instructions provided for this lab.  You may perform the other simulations and tutorials *after* this training course is complete.

## You have completed the lab.
